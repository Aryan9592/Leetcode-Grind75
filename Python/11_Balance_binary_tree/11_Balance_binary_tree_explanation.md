### Question name: [Balance binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

#### Question description: 
```
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
```

### Explaination
This code defines a class Solution with a method isBalanced, which is used to determine whether a binary tree is balanced or not. A balanced binary tree is a tree in which the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most 1. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Method isBalanced:

This method takes one parameter, root, which is the root node of the binary tree. It is of type Optional[TreeNode], meaning it can be a TreeNode or None (if the tree is empty).
The method returns a boolean value: True if the binary tree is balanced, and False otherwise.
Height Calculation Function height:

The code defines an inner function called height. This function calculates the height of a binary tree rooted at a given node. The height of a node is the maximum depth of its left or right subtree.
Recursive Approach:

The isBalanced method uses a recursive approach to check the balance of the binary tree.
If the root is None (indicating an empty tree), it returns True because an empty tree is considered balanced by definition.
Height Calculation:

The code calculates the heights of the left and right subtrees of the current root node using the height function.
left_height is assigned the height of the left subtree.
right_height is assigned the height of the right subtree.
Balance Check:

It then checks whether the absolute difference between left_height and right_height is less than or equal to 1. This condition ensures that the current node's subtree heights do not differ by more than 1 level, which is a criterion for balance.
Recursive Calls:

The code also makes two recursive calls:
self.isBalanced(root.left) checks if the left subtree is balanced.
self.isBalanced(root.right) checks if the right subtree is balanced.
Returning True or False:

If the current node and both of its subtrees are balanced (i.e., the conditions are met), the method returns True.
If any of the conditions fail (e.g., the height difference is greater than 1 or either subtree is not balanced), the method returns False.
In summary, this code uses recursion to traverse the binary tree and check for balance by comparing the heights of the left and right subtrees at each node. If the tree meets the criteria of a balanced binary tree, the method returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
